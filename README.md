# CSC Primitive Efficiency Measurement Package
====================

## About
--- tested in CMSSW_10_4_10, needed to run full 2022 dataset
* It is based on the tag-and-probe method using the Z pole or the J/Ïˆ pole;
* The efficiency obtained is the CSC detector efficiency times the efficiency that the muon is not scattered.
* Need RAW information to get the LCT efficiency. RECO or AOD sample is not enough.

## Installation
<pre>
cmsrel CMSSW_14_0_7
cd CMSSW_14_0_7/src
cmsenv
mkdir CSCEfficiency
git clone https://github.com/herndon/CSCefficiency CSCEfficiency
scramv1 b
</pre>

## Make the Ntuple
1. Modify the config file [create_ntuple_local.py](CSCEfficiency/create_ntuple_local.py). 
The output file name can be changed in the following line ---
<pre>
process.aoddump.rootFileName=cms.untracked.string('???.root')
</pre>

2. Run [create_ntuple_local.py](CSCEfficiency/create_ntuple_local.py). CRAB is recommended
<pre>
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
cmsRun create_ntuple_local.py
</pre>

or
There is a CRAB submission file [crabConfig_CSCEff_v1.py](CSCEfficiency/crabConfig_CSCEff_v1.py). Also be sure to check you are using a compatible global tag if you are using a more recent release.
<pre>
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
crab submit -c crabConfig_CSCEff_v1.py
</pre>


## Make the Efficiency plots
See files in [NtupleScripts](CSCEfficiency/NtupleScripts/.)
After modifying CSCEffFast.h to point to your T&P output Ntuple files run in root using:
<pre>
root -b
.L CSCEffFast.C+
CSCEffFast* cscEffFast = new CSCEffFast()
</pre>
This makes the file cscEffHistoFile.root
The file commands.txt has commands to make pretty plots from cscEffHistoFile.root.
There is scipt to make plots automatically.  However, you likely have to create of copy over the directory structure made under plots/ first.
<pre>
root6
.x PlotCSCEffFast.C
</pre>
